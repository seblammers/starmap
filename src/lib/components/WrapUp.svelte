  I found fascinating random historical facts while browsing this map of the
  night sky. For example, the use of compasses (in Europe) goes back all the way
  to the year 1199 CE. John Wayne died in 1979. The Phoenician alphabet was
  created already in 1050 BCE. And paper was invented in 200 BCE in the Han
  dynasty? Wow.
